# PyPSA-FES: A linear optimisation model to simulate Great Britain's energy transition

PyPSA-FES offers a complete data pipeline and optimisation backbone to model any year between 2023 and 2050 of Great Britain's energy transition both for an optimisic transition scenario _Leading the Way_, and a pessimistic version _Falling Short_. For the chosen scenario and year, the model dynamically retrieves parameters on generation, transmission and storage capacities, demand and emission targets from [_national grid ESO's Future Energy Scenarios_](https://www.nationalgrideso.com/future-energy/future-energy-scenarios), and runs a full year of hourly investment and operational optimisation for a 16-zonal network. Neighbouring countries are modelled as single nodes, to realistically capture opportunities for electricity trading via interconnectors.

Our model builds on the highly popular [PyPSA-Eur model](github.com/pypsa/pypsa-eur), which has been adapted to focus on the electricity sector in the United Kingdom.

For details on installation, tutorial, and a deeper overview of model assumptions we refer to the [documentation](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Additionally, the model includes three types of domestic demand flexibility, that can be switched on or off
- **Demand Flexibility Service**; individual households shifting their demand in time.
- **Smart Heat Pumps** storing heat provided by heat pumps in homes' thermal inertia.
- **Smart Charging Electric Vehicles** and **Vehicle-to-Grid** according to centrally optimised schedules.

While only considering electricity demand, the model aims to assume a role that fits with the transition of the larger multi-sector energy system:

- Increased electricity demand due to electrification of heat and transport.
- Negative emissions using carbon capture and storage, simulating carbon trading with hard to abate sectors.
- Competition for biomass supply with other sectors.

![Energy Flows Modelled in PyPSA-FES](doc/img/pypsa_fes_flowchart.PNG)

The model is an adaption of the [PyPSA-Eur](github.com/pypsa/pypsa-eur), a sector-coupled european energy model, developed at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/ensys), built on the underlying Python modelling library [PyPSA](github.com/pypsa/pypsa). For more details on the underlying PyPSA-Eur model, we refer to the [model documentation](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io) or related research for instance [PyPSA-Eur: An Open Optimisation Model of the European Transmission System](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01613), 2018, [arXiv:1806.01613](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01613). 

The model is governed through a __snakemake__ workflow.  Please see the [documentation](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/) for installation instructions and other useful information about the snakemake workflow. The model is designed to be imported into the open toolbox [PyPSA](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA).
