# PyPSA-FES: A linear optimisation model to simulate Great Britain's energy transition

PyPSA-FES offers a complete data pipeline and optimisation backbone to model any year between 2023 and 2050 of Great Britain's energy transition both for an optimisic transition scenario _Leading the Way_, and a pessimistic version _Falling Short_. For the chosen scenario and year, the model dynamically retrieves constraints on generation, transmission and storage capacities, demand and emission targets from [_national grid ESO's Future Energy Scenarios_](https://www.nationalgrideso.com/future-energy/future-energy-scenarios), and runs a full year of hourly investment and operational optimisation for a 16-zonal network.

Additionally, the model includes three types of domestic demand flexibility, that can be switched on or off
- **Demand Flexibility Service** individual households can provide to the grid by shifting their demand in time
- **Smart Heat Pumps** storing heat provided by heat pumps in homes' thermal inertia
- **Smart Charging Electric Vehicles** and **Vehicle-to-Grid** according to centrally optimised schedules.

![Energy Flows Modelled in PyPSA-FES](doc/img/pypsa_fes_flowchart.PNG)

The model is an adaption of the [PyPSA-Eur](github.com/pypsa/pypsa-eur), a sector-coupled european energy model, developed at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/ensys), and is built on the underlying Python modelling library [PyPSA](github.com/pypsa/pypsa).


In this repo we explore whole-system implications of demand flexibility events as in [The Big Dirty Turn Down](https://www.centrefornetzero.org/work/energy-flexibility-domestic-research-octopus-energy/).

For this purpose, we make modifications to the energy model [PyPSA-Eur](github.com/pypsa/pypsa-eur), which is a linear model of the European energy system that optimises both operation and capacity expansion.

The present repo is a work in progress, but will feature interactive scenario presentations, and a ready-to-use pipeline to conduct various experiments.

For more details on the underlying PyPSA-Eur model, we refer to the [model documentation](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io) or related research for instance [PyPSA-Eur: An Open Optimisation Model of the European Transmission System](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01613), 2018, [arXiv:1806.01613](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01613). The model building routines are defined through a snakemake workflow.  Please see the [documentation](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/) for installation instructions and other useful information about the snakemake workflow. The model is designed to be imported into the open toolbox [PyPSA](https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA).


The network is built up on the transmission network nodes from [PyPSA-Eur](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur):

![network diagram](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/master/doc/img/base.png?raw=true)

For computational reasons the model is usually clustered down
to 50-200 nodes.

Already-built versions of the model can be found in the accompanying [Zenodo
repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3601881).

# Python-Template

Centre for Net Zero's template for Python projects.

Tools:

* [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for dependency management
* [Pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/) for testing
* [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for type checking
* [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting
* [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) and [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting

There are two Github Actions workflows:

* `test_and_lint.yaml` runs checks on a Ubuntu Github-hosted runner.
* `container.yaml` runs the same checks but inside a Docker container and pushes images to [Google Cloud Platform Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry).

## Secrets configuration

If you want to use the Docker workflow, you need to set the following secrets:

* `GCP_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY`, e.g. `LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT-ID`
* `GCP_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_SA_KEY`, the key for a service account with the roles to push and pull images.

## Python Setup

You need to [set up your Python environment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tg0eKalqOp-IJEeH7aShc9fYF5zn95H6jxEk25BLLUE/) first.

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `make setup` in your terminal.

In step 2 this will:

* Run `pipenv sync --dev` to install dependencies.
* `cp .env.template .env` to create your local `.env` file - make sure you fill in any blanks.
* Install your local pre-commit environment which will be used to maintain code standards
* Check the tests work by running `pipenv run pytest`
